This module is responsible for defining various oscillators.

Each oscillator renders a sawtooth waveform to an array, but with different
implementations (in particular, surrounding the detune parameter) for the sake
of examining the resulting differences in the output buffers.

Note: oscillators assume a standard sample rate of 44.1kHz.

    The resampling oscillator takes a different approach to applying detune

    pitching up a static buffer.

    In particular, this oscillator draws an intermediate buffer before rendering
    its true output. This is so that the frequency value can be used to render
    a waveform independent of the detune parameter, then we resample the
    intermediate buffer to accommodate the detune value.

    This approach introduces phase artifacts that, when played back next to a
    different, slightly out of tune, sawtooth wave, creates an interesting
    zipper-like characteristic in the sound.
